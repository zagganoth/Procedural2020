better storage
build your own village
build your own biome!

- somehow change heat/cold levels?
combat:
- (all) mobs have unique, useful drops
- side dash
enchantments:

weather?
exploration needs to be more interesting.
- initially, maintain sense of discovery
- try to guide players with intuition
- somehow force people to build multiple bases?
- add events to break up monotony?
- meteors force exploration
- more biome pets?
- trains!
- more dimensions
technology:
- ages
inventory
